=== Backend (FastAPI) ===
1) Add to backend/requirements.txt:
   redis>=5.0.0
2) Ensure app/main.py includes:
   from app.routers import chat
   app.include_router(chat.router)
3) Docker Compose must have a Redis service named "redis". (You already do.)
4) Rebuild & up:
   docker compose build --no-cache api
   docker compose up -d
   docker compose logs -f api
5) Create rooms from a group (owner or member):
   POST /chat/rooms/from-group/{group_id}

=== Frontend (React) ===
- Copy frontend/Chat.jsx to your src/components (or src/) and import it in App.jsx.
- Render <Chat token={token}/> behind auth.

=== Quick test ===
- Owner creates a group, applicant joins & gets approved (membership).
- Owner (or member) calls POST /chat/rooms/from-group/{group_id} once.
- Open the web, navigate to Chat tab, select the room, send messages from two different browsers/sessions.
